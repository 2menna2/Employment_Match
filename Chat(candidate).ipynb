      "\n",
      "Of course! Here are 5 common interview questions for a Software Engineer, mixing technical and behavioral aspects, with brief explanations for why they are asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "***\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Technical (Data Structures & Algorithms): \"Given an array of integers and a target number, find two numbers in the array that sum up to the target. What is the time and space complexity of your solution?\"**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** This is a classic coding challenge, often called \"Two Sum.\" It's an excellent filter to assess a candidate's fundamental problem-solving and coding skills. The interviewer is looking for more than just a brute-force solution; they want to see if you can optimize it (typically using a hash map or set) and correctly analyze its performance in terms of Big O notation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Behavioral (Problem-Solving & Resilience): \"Tell me about a time you were stuck on a difficult technical problem. How did you eventually solve it?\"**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** This question assesses your problem-solving methodology, persistence, and resourcefulness. The interviewer wants to understand your process. Do you give up easily? Do you ask for help? Do you use debugging tools, read documentation, or try to break the problem down into smaller pieces? It reveals how you handle the frustration and ambiguity inherent in software development.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Technical (System Design): \"How would you design a URL shortening service like TinyURL?\"**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** This question moves beyond a single algorithm to test your ability to think at a higher level. The interviewer is evaluating your understanding of system components, trade-offs, and scalability. Your answer should touch on APIs (how users interact with the service), data storage (how to store the long and short URLs), the hashing algorithm (how to generate the short key), and potential issues like collisions and scaling for millions of users.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Behavioral (Teamwork & Retrospection): \"Describe a project that didn't go as planned. What happened, what was your role, and what did you learn from the experience?\"**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** No project is perfect. This question probes for self-awareness, accountability, and a growth mindset. The interviewer wants to see if you can take ownership of mistakes without blaming others and, most importantly, if you can learn from failure to improve in the future. A good answer focuses on the lessons learned and how you've applied them since.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Technical (Practical Application & Code Quality): \"What do you look for when you review a teammate's code?\"**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** This is a fantastic real-world question that reveals a candidate's understanding of what makes good software. It’s not about finding every tiny mistake. A strong answer will mention checking for correctness, readability, maintainability, test coverage, and security vulnerabilities. It also shows your ability to provide constructive feedback and collaborate effectively, demonstrating that you are a good engineering citizen.\n"
